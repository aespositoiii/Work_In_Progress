    "1. Describe the null hypotheses to which the p-values given in Table 3.4 correspond.  Explain what conclusions you can draw based on these p-values.  Your explanation should be phrased in terms of sales, TV, radio, and newspaper, rather than in terms of the coefficients of the linear model.\n",
    "    1. The null hypotheses to which these p-values correspond are those for which the respective predictor (TV, radio, or newspaper) have no impact on sales.\n",

    "1. Carefully explain the differences between the KNN classifier and KNN regression methods.\n",
    "    1. The KNN classifier and regression methods rely on similiar logic but their functions are dramatically different.  The classifier operates on a categorical basis predicting the class to which a new datapoint belongs based on a distance measure to the K nearest points where K is some positive integer number.  The regression method operates in a similar manner but instead of predicting the class to which a datapoint belongs it predicts the quantitative response anticipated from the given data.\n",

    "        1. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, males earn more on average than femails provided that the GPA is high enough.  The coefficient for gender is (beta3 - beta5\\*GPA) which substitutes as (35-10\\*GPA).  This means that over a 3.5 GPA and males earn higher salaries after graduation.\n",

    "1. I collect a set of data (n = 100 observations) containing a single predictor and a quantitative response.  I then fit a linear regression model to the data, as well as a seperate cubic regression.  ie Y = beta0 + beta1 * X + beta2 * X^2 * beta3 * X^3 + eta. \n",

Consider that training RSS for the linear regression, and also the training RSS for the cubic regression.
